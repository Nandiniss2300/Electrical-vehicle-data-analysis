## Datasets

The data used in this project includes:
- EV sales data from various regions.
- Charging station locations and usage statistics.
- Battery performance and degradation data.
- Government incentives and policies related to EVs.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ev-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ev-data-analysis
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the data:
    ```sh
    python scripts/preprocess_data.py
    ```

2. Perform the analysis:
    ```sh
    python scripts/analyze_data.py
    ```

3. Generate visualizations:
    ```sh
    python scripts/visualize_data.py
    ```
